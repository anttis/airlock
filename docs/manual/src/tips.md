# Tips and tricks

This section collects practical patterns that occur often in day-to-day
work with airlock. None of this is required reading, but it can save
you some time.

[Pairing with mise](./tips/mise.md) shows how to use mise as a task runner
alongside airlock — installing airlock as a mise tool, building local Docker
images for sandboxes, and loading secrets per task.

[Open-network bootstrap](./tips/init-with-open-network.md)
shows how to run a one-off init script with `airlock start --network` while
keeping `deny-by-default` in `airlock.toml`.

[Docker inside the VM](./tips/docker.md) covers two approaches for running
Docker containers inside an airlock sandbox: forwarding the host Docker
socket (easy but has caveats) and running a full Docker engine inside
the VM.
